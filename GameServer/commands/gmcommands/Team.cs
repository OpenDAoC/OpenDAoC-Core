/* <--- SendMessage Standardization --->
*  All messages now use translation IDs to both
*  centralize their location and standardize the method
*  of message calls used throughout this project. All messages affected
*  are in English. Other languages are not yet supported.
* 
*  To  find a message at its source location, either use
*  the message body contained in the comment above the return
*  (e.g., // Message: This is a message.) or the
*  translation ID (e.g., "AdminCommands.Account.Description").
* 
*  To perform message changes, take note of your server settings.
*  If the `serverproperty` table setting `use_dblanguage`
*  is set to `True`, you must make your changes from the
*  `languagesystem` DB table.
* 
*  If the `serverproperty` table setting
*  `update_existing_db_system_sentences_from_files` is set to `True`,
*  perform changes to messages using the .txt files locate in "GameServer >
*  language > EN".
*
*  OPTIONAL: After changing a message, paste the new string
*  into the comment above the affected method(s). This is
*  done for ease of reference. */
